HOW DO YOU MAKE GOOD HOMEMADE CHILI

- Start with bacon! Cook until crisp, remove to a paper-towel lined plate, and reserve a bit of the grease for cooking your veggies. The flavor that develops from this step elevates a great chili recipe to the best chili recipe.
- Cook your onion and pepper until soft, add garlic and cook until fragrant.
- Add your ground beef, once it’s mostly browned add all your seasonings and stir well!
- Add the remaining ingredients, give everything a good stir, and allow to simmer for at least 30 minutes and until liquid is reduced.

THE BEST CHILI TOPPINGS:

-Sour cream
-Shredded Cheddar Cheese (currently obsessed with Tillamook’s thick shred cheese OMG)
-Corn chips (Fritos or crushed Tostitos are my favorite)
-Sliced Jalapenos
-Scallions/green onion
-Additional Bacon
-Avocado
-Sour cream is an absolute must for any good chili recipe, I can’t enjoy chili without it anymore
