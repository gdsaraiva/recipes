Test Kitchen Tips

*If your frosting is too thick, add a touch more milk. If itâ€™s too thin, add a little more powdered sugar.
*Make sure your butter is at room temperature before making frosting. Learn how to soften butter quickly here.
*The vanilla flavor in this recipe will really shine through, so we recommend using a pure extract.
